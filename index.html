                    <img src="images/Me.jpg" alt="This is the same photo of me I use on my blog!" />
                    <p>My name is Kalinda, and I write the blog <a href="http://www.wheatfreemeatfree.com/">Wheat-Free Meat-Free</a>. I started the blog in 2008. It's a recipe blog. All the recipes it features are gluten-free and vegetarian.</p>
                    <p>When I started, I had some idea of what I was doing with regards to cooking, and no idea what I was doing with regards to photos. Now, I have a pretty good idea what I am doing with regards to cooking and middling photography skills!

                    <p>I also have a cookbook based on my blog. It took a long time to write. I will not be writing another one. </p>
